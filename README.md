- 💼 I’m a software engineer, working full time on **PHP/Laravel** and other backend technologies

- ♥️ Absolutely **love**: UI/UX designing, cloud computing, open source, software architecture and much more!

- 🧘🏻‍♂️ If I'm not talking computers, it's probably video games, philosophy/psychology or food 🍔

- 💻 Currently source diving on Laravel and trying to improve my web design skills!

- 📚 Oh and! Reading [Six of Crows](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23437156-six-of-crows), [Flow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66354.Flow) and [Laravel Queues in Action](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55151414-laravel-queues-in-action) whenever I can! 🤓
